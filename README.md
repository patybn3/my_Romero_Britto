Create your own character/scene/artwork
You can use your favorite painting as inspiration

I chose a piece by a Brazilian artist named Romero Britto. His art is inspired by cubism, modernism, pop art, and graffiti, and he is a
painter, serigrapher, and sculptor. He is currently 57 years old ad of 2020 and
is an active artist.
The painting chosen is called evolution. I did not have any specific
reasons to choose this painting other than the fact that I liked it.
My reason for choosing this artist is because I believe he has done a
phenomenal job in applying cubism to pop art.

I have used other sources, as detailed in my submitted source file.
List these sources
